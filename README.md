## Frontend Battle – Round 1: Replicate & Innovate

This project was developed for **Frontend Battle 2.0 – Round 1**, held on **June 19, 2025**, from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM IST. The challenge was to replicate and enhance a provided set of video and image assets by building a fully responsive and animated web page.

## Problem Statement Summary

Participants were given high-resolution assets and tasked with building a responsive, deployed, and publicly accessible web application using at least 6 features from the resources. Innovation was encouraged through subtle but meaningful enhancements like animations and improved UX.

## Tools & Credits

- Used **ChatGPT** and **Grok** to generate the initial JSX structure and framer-motion setup.
- All enhancements, animations, styling, and layout fine-tuning were done by me.
- Ripple effects, dynamic charts, and interactivity were refined manually.

## Features Implemented

- Responsive layout using Tailwind CSS
- Dynamic animated data visualizations
- Custom ripple effect on mouse movement
- Scroll-based animations (Framer Motion)
- Dark/Light mode toggle
- Fully functional navbar linking to sections
- Loader animation as provided in the assets

## Deployment

- The site is deployed on [Vercel / Netlify / etc.] https://frontend-battles.vercel.app/
